# Profit, Loss, Interest, and Discount Formulas

## Profit and Loss
1. **Profit**:  
   ```
   Profit = Selling Price (SP) - Cost Price (CP)
   ```

2. **Loss**:  
   ```
   Loss = Cost Price (CP) - Selling Price (SP)
   ```

3. **Profit Percentage**:  
   ```
   Profit % = (Profit / Cost Price (CP)) × 100
   ```

4. **Loss Percentage**:  
   ```
   Loss % = (Loss / Cost Price (CP)) × 100
   ```

5. **Selling Price (SP)** (when Profit is given):  
   ```
   SP = CP × (1 + Profit % / 100)
   ```

6. **Selling Price (SP)** (when Loss is given):  
   ```
   SP = CP × (1 - Loss % / 100)
   ```

7. **Cost Price (CP)** (when Profit is given):  
   ```
   CP = SP / (1 + Profit % / 100)
   ```

8. **Cost Price (CP)** (when Loss is given):  
   ```
   CP = SP / (1 - Loss % / 100)
   ```

## Simple Interest
1. **Simple Interest (SI)**:  
   ```
   SI = (P × R × T) / 100
   ```  
   Where:  
   - `P` = Principal amount  
   - `R` = Rate of interest per annum  
   - `T` = Time in years  

2. **Amount (A)** after Simple Interest:  
   ```
   A = P + SI
   ```

---

## Compound Interest
1. **Compound Interest (CI)**:  
   ```
   CI = A - P
   ```  
   Where:  
   - `A` = Amount after interest  
   - `P` = Principal amount  

2. **Amount (A)** after Compound Interest:  
   ```
   A = P × (1 + R / 100)^T
   ```

3. **For Compound Interest with Different Compounding Intervals**:  
   ```
   A = P × (1 + (R / n × 100))^(n × T)
   ```  
   Where:  
   - `n` = Number of times compounded per year

## Discount
1. **Discount**:  
   ```
   Discount = Marked Price (MP) - Selling Price (SP)
   ```

2. **Discount Percentage**:  
   ```
   Discount % = (Discount / Marked Price (MP)) × 100
   ```

3. **Selling Price (SP)** after Discount:  
   ```
   SP = MP × (1 - Discount % / 100)
   ```

4. **Marked Price (MP)**:  
   ```
   MP = SP / (1 - Discount % / 100)
   ```

---

## Successive Discounts
If two successive discounts of `x%` and `y%` are given:

1. **Effective Discount**:  
   ```
   Effective Discount = x + y - (x × y) / 100
   ```

2. **Final Price after Successive Discounts**:  
   ```
   SP = MP × (1 - x / 100) × (1 - y / 100)
   ```

---

## Miscellaneous
1. **Percentage Increase/Decrease**:  
   ```
   Percentage Change = (Change in Value / Original Value) × 100
   ```  
   Positive value = Increase, Negative value = Decrease.

2. **Profit on Marked Price**:  
   If profit is calculated on the Marked Price:  
   ```
   SP = MP × (1 - Discount % / 100) × (1 + Profit % / 100)
   ```
