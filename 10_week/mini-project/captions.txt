chapter one resources
Mona and Raju were helping Amma to clean
their house
look at all these things clothes
utensils
food grains
Combs this bottle of Honey books
each of these has a use said Mona
that is why they are important
said Amma
these are resources
what is a resource
was raju's question to Amma
anything that can be used to satisfy a
need is a resource replied Amma
look around you and observe
you will be able to identify many types
of resources
the water you drink when you are thirsty
the electricity you use in your house
the Rickshaw you use to get home from
school
the textbook you use to study are all
resources
your father has prepared a tasty snack
for you
the fresh vegetables he has used are
also a resource utility and value
water
electricity
rickshaw
vegetables
and textbook have something in common
they have all been used by you so they
have utility
utility or usability is what makes an
object or substance a resource
how does something become a resource
Raju wanted to know
Amma told the children that Things
become resources only when they have a
value
its use or utility gives it a value
all resources have some value
said Amma value means what
some resources have economic value so
some do not
for example
Metals may have an economic value
a beautiful landscape may not
but both are important and satisfy human
needs
some resources can become economically
valuable with time
your grandmother's home remedies have no
commercial value today
but if they are patented and sold by a
medical firm tomorrow they could become
economically valuable
patent it means the exclusive right over
any idea or invention time and
Technology
time and Technology are two important
factors that can change substances into
resources
technology means the application of
latest knowledge and skill in doing or
making things
both are related to the needs of the
people
themselves are the most important
resource
it is their ideas knowledge inventions
and discoveries that lead to the
creation of more resources
each Discovery or invention leads to
many others
the discovery of fire led to the
practice of cooking and other processes
while the invention of the wheel
ultimately resulted in development of
newer modes of transport
the technology to create
hydroelectricity has turned energy in
fast flowing water into an important
resource types of resources
resources are generally classified into
natural
human-made and human
so let's first have a look at Natural
Resources
resources that are drawn from nature and
used without much modification are
called natural resources
like the air we breathe
the water in our rivers
and lakes
the soils
minerals
are all natural resources
many of these resources are free gifts
of Nature and can be used directly
in some cases tools and Technology may
be needed to use a natural resource in
the best possible way
natural resources are classified into
different groups depending upon their
level of development and use origin
stock and distribution
classification on basis of development
and use
on the basis of their development and
use resources can be classified into two
groups actual resources and potential
resources
actual resources are those resources
whose quantity is known
these resources are being used in the
present
the rich deposits of coal in rural
region of Germany and petroleum in the
West Asia
the dark soils in the Deccan Plateau in
Maharashtra are all actual resources
potential resources are those whose
entire quantity may not be known and
these are not being used at present
these resources could be used in the
future
the level of Technology we have at
present may not be Advanced enough to
easily utilize these resources
the uranium found in ladakh is an
example of potential resource that could
be used in the future
high-speed wins were a potential
resource 200 years ago
today they are an actual resource and
wind farms generate energy using
windmills like in Netherlands
in Tamil Nadu and on the Gujarat course
classification on basis of origin based
on their origin resources can be abiotic
or biotic
abiotic resources are non-living well
biotic resources are living
soils rocks and minerals are abiotic
but plants and animals are biotic
resources
natural resources can be broadly
categorized into renewable and
non-renewable resources renewable
resources are those which get renewed
and replenished quickly
some of these are unlimited and are not
affected by human activities such as
solar and wind energy
yet careless use of certain renewable
resources like water soil
and Forest can affect their stock
of resource means the amount of
resources available for use
water seems to be an unlimited renewable
resource
but shortage and drying up of natural
water sources is a major problem in many
parts of the world today non-renewable
resources are those which have a limited
stock
once the stocks are exhausted it may
take thousands of years to be renewed or
replenished
since this period is much more than
human life spans such resources are
considered non-renewable
coal petroleum
a natural gas are some examples
classification of resources on the basis
of distribution
on the basis of their distribution
resources can be ubiquitous or localized
resources that are found everywhere like
the air we breathe are ubiquitous
but those which are found only in
certain places are localized like copper
and iron ore
the distribution of Natural Resources
depends upon number of physical factors
like terrain climate and altitude
the distribution of resources is unequal
because these factors differ so much
over the Earth human-made Resources
sometimes natural substances become
resources only when their original form
has been changed
iron ore was not a resource until people
learned to extract iron from it
people use natural resources to make
buildings Bridges
roads
machinery
and vehicles
which are known as human-made resources
technology is also a human-made resource
so people like us use natural resources
to make human-made resources
said Mona Notting in understanding
yes said Raju
human resources
people can make the best use of nature
to create more resources when they have
the knowledge skill and the technology
to do so
that is why human beings are a special
resource
people are human resources
education and health help in making
people a valuable resource
improving the quality of people's skills
so that they are able to create more
resources is known as human resource
development
do you know human resource refers to the
number that is quantity and abilities
that is mental and physical of the
people
though there are differing views
regarding treatment of humans as a
resource one cannot deny the fact that
it is the abilities of human that help
in transferring the physical material
into valuable resource conserving
resources
Muna had a nightmare
she dreamed that all the water on the
earth had dried up and all the trees cut
down
there was no shade and nothing to eat or
drink
people were suffering and roaming around
desperately looking for food and shade
she told her mother about the dream
Amma can this really happen she asked
yes Ahmad replied if we are not careful
then even renewable resources can become
very scarce and the non-renewable ones
can definitely get exhausted
what can we do about it Raju asked Lots
replied Amma
that evening the children and their
friends made packets and shopping bags
out of old newspapers discarded clothes
and baskets from bamboo sticks
we will give a few to every family we
know said Mona
after all it is for a very good cause
to save our resources and to keep our
Earth alive
I'm going to be very careful not to
waste paper
said Jesse
many trees are cut down to make paper
she explained I will see that
electricity is not wasted in my house
shouted Mustafa
electricity comes from water and coal
I will make sure that water is not
wasted at home
said Asha every drop of water is
precious
together we can make a difference
chorus the children
these are some of the things Mona Raju
and their friends did
what about you
how are you going to help in conserving
resources
using resources carefully and giving
them time to get renewed is called
resource conservation
balancing the need to use resources and
also conserve them for the future is
called sustainable development
sustainable development means carefully
utilizing resources so that besides
meeting the requirements of the present
also takes care of future Generations
there are many ways of conserving
resources
each person can contribute by reducing
consumption
recycling
and reusing things
ultimately it makes a difference because
all our lives are linked
the future of our planet and its people
is linked with our ability to maintain
and preserve the life support system
that nature provides
therefore it is our duty to ensure that
all users of renewable resources are
sustainable
the diversity of life on the earth is
conserved
the damage to Natural environmental
system is minimized some principles of
sustainable development
respect and care for all forms of life
improve the quality of human life
conserve the Earth's vitality and
diversity
minimize the depletion of Natural
Resources
change personal attitudes and practices
towards the environment
enable communities to care for their own
environment
